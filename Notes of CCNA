   # ethernet cable
     - The physical medium that transmits electrical signals (Layer 1) between networking devices like PCs, switches, routers, etc

   # hub
     - a basic networking device that broadcasts incoming data to all connected devices, without intelligent direction
     - it repeats signals blindly, so it causes more collisions and is inefficient compared to switches
   
   # switches
     - switches are fundamental to networking as they allow devices to connect and communicate efficiently within a local Area Network (LAN)
     - a device that intelligently directs Ethernet frames to the correct device in the network using MAC addresses

   # Wireless access points
     - Wireless Access Points (WAPs) can behave similarly to hubs in some modes, especially when configured as bridges or repeaters, broadcasting data without selective forwarding
     - most modern WAPs do act like switches (smart forwarding), but older or simpler devices may not
     - using wireless instead of wired has implications on:
          Security    (e.g., risk of interception, need for encryption like WPA3)
          Performance (e.g., signal interference, lower speed, higher latency)

   # Layer references & terms
       Physical cable (Layer 1) – carries raw bits as electrical or optical signals
       MAC Address    (Layer 2) – used by switches to forward frames; a unique hardware identifier for network devices
       IP Address     (Layer 3) – used for routing packets across networks (logical address)
     - Layer 2 uses frames, Layer 3 uses packets
     - Networking messages are called frames at Layer 2 (when handled by switches) and packets at Layer 3 (when handled by routers).

   # cam table
     - switches use MAC addresses to make forwarding decisions, stored in a Content Addressable Memory (CAM) table
     - CLI command to view MAC address table (cisco):
       #enable
       #show mac address-table

   # Send ping in Cisco Packet Tracer (from device terminal):
       ping 10.1.1.1 (IP Address)

// lacture - 02

   # router (layer-3)
     - a router is used to connect two or more different networks
     - a switch connects devices within the same network, such as 10.1.1.0 to 10.1.1.255 — also referred to as 10.1.1.0/24, where /24 means the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0.
     - different networks means they are on different IP ranges, like 10.1.1.0/24 and 192.168.1.0/24
     - routers are Layer 3 devices in the OSI model. they handle IP addresses and make routing decisions based on destination IP
     - in Cisco Packet Tracer, you can use Simulation Mode to inspect how packets travel and which ports, cables, and interfaces are involved

   # subnet
     - a subnet is like a floor in a building — it divides the whole IP address space (building) into smaller, manageable groups (floors) so each device (room) knows where it belongs
     - benifits
       divides a large network into smaller groups, making devices easier to manage.
       allows control over which subnet can communicate with another — improves security.
       reduces network traffic by keeping broadcasts within the subnet.
       helps utilize IP addresses efficiently — avoids wasting addresses.
       easier troubleshooting — issues are isolated within a subnet, not the entire network.

    -  IP address
       format: 8 bits + 8 bits + 8 bits + 8 bits = 32 bits → This is called IPv4 (most commonly used today) 
       there is also IPv6, which uses 128 bits and is a newer version with far more addresses
       in a /24 network:
         the first 24 bits are reserved for the network (e.g., 10.1.1)
         the last 8 bits are used for hosts/devices like computer, mobile, etc. (e.g., 10.1.1.1 to 10.1.1.254)

    -  subnet mask
       A subnet mask tells you which part of an IP address is the network and which part is for hosts
       Without it, you can’t tell where the network ends and hosts begin
       Example:
       For IP 192.168.1.10 with subnet mask 255.255.255.0:
       255.255.255      → Network part → 192.168.1
       .0 (last 8 bits) → Host part    → can be .1, .2, .10, up to .254
       subnet mask = the dividing line between Network ID and Host ID

    -  reserved Addresses in a Subnet
       in 10.1.1.0/24:
       /24 is the CIDR notation (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
       10.1.1.0   → Network ID        (reserved)
       10.1.1.255 → Broadcast Address (reserved)
       usable host range → 10.1.1.1 to 10.1.1.254
       gives us 254 usable IP addresses for devices

    -  subnetting
       Subnetting = Borrowing bits from the host part to create more subnets
       in a /24 network:
         24 bits for network, 8 bits for host
         IPs range: 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254
       in a /26 network
         you borrow 2 more bits from the host portion
         subnet mask becomes 255.255.255.192
         26 bits = network  (building floor)
         6 bits  = host     (room on that floor)
         2⁶ = 64 total IPs  (binary is a number system that uses only 0s and 1s, where each position represents a power of 2)
         62 usable (1 network ID, 1 broadcast)
         so /26 gives 4 subnets within a /24
          192.168.1.0/26   →  .1 to .62   (usable)
          192.168.1.64/26  → .65 to .126  (usable)
          192.168.1.128/26 → .129 to .190 (usable)
          192.168.1.192/26 → .193 to .254 (usable)
        subnet-size math shortcut = Block size = 256 – last-octet value (e.g. 256 – 192 = 64) 


    -  IP address binary
       example-1
       if there is /26,
       /26 → 26 bits for the network
       32 − 26 = 6 bits for host = 6 zeros at the end

       subnet Mask Decimal: 255.255.255.192
       subnet Mask Binary : 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000

       convert last 8 bits (11000000) to decimal:

       Binary:     1   1   0   0   0   0   0   0
       Place:    128  64  32  16   8   4   2   1

       Multiply the bits by their place values
       1×128 + 1×64 + 0×32 + 0×16 + 0×8 + 0×4 + 0×2 + 0×1 = 192

       so it will give us,
       255.255.255.192

       example-2
       255.255.255.0       
       11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000

       example-3
       192.168.1.0       
       11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000
       


   # ARP message
     ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol
     when communicating within the same network, you ping a device’s IP address
     however, to send the packet at Layer 2, the sender must know the receiver's MAC address
     to discover that MAC address, the device sends an ARP request to the network
     the ARP request is broadcast to all devices (using the special MAC address FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF)
     once the correct device receives the ARP request, it replies with its MAC address, allowing the sender to complete the communication

   # gateway
     if you ping an IP address that is outside your network, the request is sent to the default gateway
     the default gateway is typically the router's IP address on your network
     to communicate with the gateway, your device first sends an ARP request to get the router’s MAC address
     once the MAC address is known, data is sent to the router, which then forwards it to the destination network
     on that remote network, a similar ARP process happens to locate the MAC address of the final destination
     you don’t “configure the gateway in the router” — rather, end devices (PCs) are configured with the IP address of the router as their gateway

   # DNS Server (layer-7)
     DNS stands for Domain Name System
     it translates human-readable domain names (like www.google.com) into IP addresses
     DNS is an application-layer protocol that typically uses UDP port 53
     in a network simulation:
       your PC sends a DNS query to the DNS server’s IP address
       first, it must resolve the MAC address of the DNS server (via ARP if it's in the same network)
       once the IP is resolved to a MAC address, the DNS request can be sent
       the DNS reply contains the IP address of the website you queried
       note : the ARP message does not return the DNS result — ARP is only used to get MAC addresses, not IP resolution.

     - router CLI command to know the IP addresses it hold or to view routes,
       #enable
       #show ip route

                                      - more reliable if the messgae gets fail to deliver it will deliver message again
                                      - if once the connection is establish and the first information was send to user from the server, it will wait and confirm first that the first information is reached or not
                                      - if not it will send it again and wait for the confirmation, this is called verification process - raliability
                                      - before sending any data, first it will check that they know each other, this is called TCP 3 way handshake
                                      - in other words it is called setting up the connection before exchanging any data
                                        1. SYN     message  - Syncronisation message                 -  from server to user

                                  UDP - not more reliable but seen as faster method to transport
                                - ports
                                  - destination ports are also include in this layer which is defined the target of the server
                                  - in layer-4 destination port you will see Dest Port 443 which is stand for https traffic
                                                                             Dest Port 80  which is stand for http  traffic
                                  - ephemeral port
                                    - network communication is always 2 way sendr and reciver
                                    - if we can't consider one port number for reciver means who apply get request from the server because the user is getting data from lot other server at the same time
                                    - so the device pull one temprary big port number for the communication for each different server this port number is call epheremal port number
                                    - ephemeral port is connected with the IP address of the user
