1. Importance of Switches
   - switches are fundamental to networking as they allow devices to connect and communicate

   - Switch         - A device that intelligently directs data packets to the correct device in the network
     Hub            - A basic networking device that broadcasts data to all connected devices without any intelligent data direction
     Ethernet Cable - The physical medium that transmits electrical signals between networking devices

   - MAC Address (Layer-2) - Unique identifier for devices at Layer 2, used by switches to direct frames
     IP Address  (Layer-3) - Address used at Layer 3 for routing packets; not utilized by switches for directing messages
     Frame       (Layer-1) - Data packet at Layer 2, utilized in switch communication.
     Packet                - Data unit at Layer 3, used in routing communications across networks.
     networking messages are categorized as frames (Layer 2) when handled by switches and packets (Layer 3) when addressing routing to IP addresses

   - switches use MAC addresses to make forwarding decisions, stored in a Content Addressable Memory (CAM) table
     CLI command to know access cam table
     #enable
     #show mac-address-table

   - to send message in cisco pocket tracer in cmd of that switch,
     ping 10.1.1.1 (IP Address)

   - Wireless access points often operate with the limitations similar to hubs
     the implications of using wireless connections over wired ones are addressed with an emphasis on security and performance
