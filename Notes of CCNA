1. switches
   - switches are fundamental to networking as they allow devices to connect and communicate

   - switch         - a device that intelligently directs data packets to the correct device in the network
     hub            - a basic networking device that broadcasts data to all connected devices without any intelligent data direction, it repets the signals that's it
     ethernet cable - the physical medium that transmits electrical signals between networking devices

   - Frame       (Layer-1) - utilized in switch communication, send data packet at Layer 2
     MAC Address (Layer-2) - used by switches to direct frames, unique identifier for devices at Layer 2 
     IP Address  (Layer-3) - not utilized by switches for directing messages, address used at Layer 3 for routing (select the best path) packets
     Packet                - data unit at Layer 3, used in routing (select the best path) communications across networks
     networking messages are categorized as frames (Layer 2) when handled by switches and packets (Layer 3) when addressing routing to IP addresses

   - switches use MAC addresses to make forwarding decisions, stored in a Content Addressable Memory (CAM) table
     CLI command to know access cam table
     #enable
     #show mac-address-table

   - to send message in cisco pocket tracer in cmd of that switch,
     ping 10.1.1.1 (IP Address)

   - Wireless access points often operate with the limitations similar to hubs
     the implications of using wireless connections over wired ones are addressed with an emphasis on security and performance

2. router
   - to connect two different networks we need a router, switch connects the devices which are in it network which is IP 10.1.1.0 to 10.1.1.255 (refer as : 10.1.1.0/24)
   - different network means different IP addresses range
   - ruters are layer-3 devices which can handle IP addresses
   - you can also see which cable is connected and which port and frame is conncted to the router by using stimulation mod and by click on the packages  

   - ARP Message
     to connect with the people which are on the same network we need to ping their corrrsponding IP address,
     but after ping the IP address the packet need MAC address for routing in layer-2 how it finding the MAC address,
     by sending ARP message (ARP Packet) which is Address Relation Protocol, which is also same as sending package to the same network
     after sending ARP message in OSI model tab in layer-2 FFFF.FFFF.FFFF is called brodcast address (it is sended to everyone in to the same network) 

   - gateway
     if we ping the IP address which is not in the same network the request is directly go to gateway which is nothing but router's IP address,
     the router's MAC address is also get it by sending ARP messages on the network
     gateway connects to the router after that same ARP message is go throught different network's switch and frame to identify it's MAC address
     you need to config that in to router section gateway

   - DNS Server (Layer-7)
     domain name service, it is the collection of the IP addresses corasponding to the URL name user type
     you need to config that in to router section DNS server
     same ARP message is send first to the DNS server by using it's IP address and MAC address (called layer-7),
     but in the ans (which is IP address of the URL typed) of the ARP message (in Inbound PDU Details),
     after conecting to the DNS server packet don't need to go through all the prosses of finding the MAC address of the connection router, switch and frame
     
   - router CLI command to know the IP addresses it hold,
     #enable
     #show ip route

3. networking models
   - TCP/IP     - every computer support - widely adopted
     4. APPLICATION  LAYER      - includes protocols
     3. TRASNSPORT   LAYER      - includes TCP / UDP port numbers
     2. NETWORK      LAYER      - includes router and ip addresses
     1. PHYSICAL     LAYER      - includes ethernet cables
                   - DATA LINK  - includes mac addresses
                   - PHYSICAL   - includers cables

   - OSI models (Open System Interconnect)
     7. APPLICATION  LAYER      - includes protocols
     6. PRESENTATION LAYER      
     5. SECTION      LAYER
     4. TRASNSPORT   LAYER      - includes TCP / UDP port numbers
     3. NETWORK      LAYER      - includes router and ip addresses
     2. PHYSICAL     LAYER      - includes ethernet cables
                   - DATA LINK  - includes mac addresses
