1. switches
   - switches are fundamental to networking as they allow devices to connect and communicate

   - switch         - a device that intelligently directs data packets to the correct device in the network
     hub            - a basic networking device that broadcasts data to all connected devices without any intelligent data direction, it repets the signals that's it
     ethernet cable - the physical medium that transmits electrical signals between networking devices

   -             (Layer-1) - physical cables 
     MAC Address (Layer-2) - used by switches to direct frames, unique identifier for devices
     IP Address  (Layer-3) - address used at Layer 3 for routing (select the best path) packets
     Packet                - data unit at Layer 3 called packet, which is routing (select the best path) communications across networks
     Networking messages are categorized as frames at Layer 2 (when handled by switches), and as packets at Layer 3 (when routed based on IP addresses)

   - switches use MAC addresses to make forwarding decisions, stored in a Content Addressable Memory (CAM) table
     CLI command to know access cam table
     #enable
     #show mac-address-table

   - to send message in cisco pocket tracer in cmd of that switch,
     ping 10.1.1.1 (IP Address)

   - Wireless access points often operate with the limitations similar to hubs
     the implications of using wireless connections over wired ones are addressed with an emphasis on security and performance

2. router
   - to connect two different networks we need a router, switch connects the devices which are in it network which is IP 10.1.1.0 to 10.1.1.255 (refer as : 10.1.1.0/24)
   - different network means different IP addresses range
   - ruters are layer-3 devices which can handle IP addresses
   - you can also see which cable is connected and which port and frame is conncted to the router by using stimulation mod and by click on the packages  

   - ARP Message
     to connect with the people which are on the same network we need to ping their corrrsponding IP address,
     but after ping the IP address the packet need MAC address for routing in layer-2 how it finding the MAC address,
     by sending ARP message (ARP Packet) which is Address Relation Protocol, which is also same as sending package to the same network
     after sending ARP message in OSI model tab in layer-2 FFFF.FFFF.FFFF is called brodcast address (it is sended to everyone in to the same network) 

   - gateway
     if we ping the IP address which is not in the same network the request is directly go to gateway which is nothing but router's IP address,
     the router's MAC address is also get it by sending ARP messages on the network
     gateway connects to the router after that same ARP message is go throught different network's switch and frame to identify it's MAC address
     you need to config that in to router section gateway

   - DNS Server (Layer-7)
     domain name service, it is the collection of the IP addresses corasponding to the URL name user type
     you need to config that in to router section DNS server
     same ARP message is send first to the DNS server by using it's IP address and MAC address (called layer-7),
     but in the ans (which is IP address of the URL typed) of the ARP message (in Inbound PDU Details),
     after conecting to the DNS server packet don't need to go through all the prosses of finding the MAC address of the connection router, switch and frame
     
   - router CLI command to know the IP addresses it hold,
     #enable
     #show ip route

3. networking models
   - TCP/IP     - every computer support - widely adopted
     4. APPLICATION  LAYER      - includes protocols
     3. TRASNSPORT   LAYER      - includes TCP / UDP port numbers
     2. NETWORK      LAYER      - includes router and ip addresses
     1. PHYSICAL     LAYER      - includes ethernet cables
                   - DATA LINK  - includes mac addresses
                   - PHYSICAL   - includers cables

   - OSI models (Open System Interconnect)
     7. APPLICATION  LAYER      - includes protocols
     6. PRESENTATION LAYER      
     5. SECTION      LAYER
     4. TRASNSPORT   LAYER      - includes TCP / UDP port numbers
     3. NETWORK      LAYER      - includes router and ip addresses
     2. PHYSICAL     LAYER      - includes ethernet cables
                   - DATA LINK  - includes mac addresses
                   - PHYSICAL   - includers cables

4. - how the message is include - OSI Model
     7. APPLICATION  LAYER      - http, https, DNS protocol
                                - all application layer has fixed transport layer it uses UDP or TCP or some protocol might uses both


     6. PRESENTATION LAYER      - data formate, file types & encryption
                                - it put data under global standard format like .html .xml .jpg .pdf
                                - encryption for secutity and SSL (secured soket layer) is done at this layer


     5. SECTION      LAYER      - it's role is to start the conversation between web-browser and server make sure this are authenticate and smooth
                                - once it complete it tares down the conversation
                                - managing different saction on your computes & servers like google, spotify all
                                - popular protocols,
                                  L2TP  - layer 2 turning protocol           - VPN connection
                                  RTCP  - remort transport control protocol  - helping setup phone calls
                                  H.245 -                                    - helping setup video calls
                                  SOCKS - proxy                              - helping in hiding the ip address
                                # DATA


     4. TRASNSPORT   LAYER      - includes TCP / UDP
                                  TCP - Transmission Control Protocol
                                      - more reliable if the messgae gets fail to deliver it will deliver message again
                                      - if once the connection is establish and the first information was send to user from the server, it will wait and confirm first that the first information is reached or not
                                      - if not it will send it again and wait for the confirmation, this is called verification process - raliability
                                      - before sending any data, first it will check that they know each other, this is called TCP 3 way handshake
                                      - in other words it is called setting up the connection before exchanging any data
                                        1. SYN     message  - Syncronisation message                 -  from server to user
                                        2. SYN ACK message  - Syncronisation Acknowledgement message -  from user   to server
                                        3. ACK     message  - Acknowledgement message                -  from server to user
                                  UDP - not more reliable but seen as faster method to transport
                                - ports
                                  - destination ports are also include in this layer which is defined the target of the server
                                  - in layer-4 destination port you will see Dest Port 443 which is stand for https traffic
                                                                             Dest Port 80  which is stand for http  traffic
                                  - ephemeral port
                                    - network communication is always 2 way sendr and reciver
                                    - if we can't consider one port number for reciver means who apply get request from the server because the user is getting data from lot other server at the same time
                                    - so the device pull one temprary big port number for the communication for each different server this port number is call epheremal port number
                                    - ephemeral port is connected with the IP address of the user   

                                # DATA - INFORMATION OF TRASPORT
                                # DATA - UDP/TCP | DESTINATION PORT :443 SOURCE PORT (EPHEMERAL PORT): 57059
                                # this is called SEGMENT


     3. NETWORK      LAYER      - includes router and ip addresses
                                # DATA - INFORMATION OF TRANSPORT - SENDER AND RECIVER IP ADDRESS
                                # this is called PACKET


     2. DATA LINK    LAYER      - includes mac addresses
                                # TAILER - DATA - INFORMATION OF TRANSPORT - SENDER AND RECIVER IP ADDRESS - SENDER AND RECIEVER MAC ADDRESS
                                # this is called FRAME


     1. PHYSICAL     LAYER      - includes ethernet cables
